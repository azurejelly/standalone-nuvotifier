# azure's NuVotifier fork ![build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/azurejelly/standalone-nuvotifier/build.yml)
A NuVotifier fork with Redis forwarding support and a standalone server implementation. From the original README:
> NuVotifier is a secure alternative to using the original Votifier project. 
> NuVotifier will work in place of Votifier - any vote listener that supports 
> Votifier will also support NuVotifier.

## Running
You can get the latest release directly from GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/azurejelly/standalone-nuvotifier/releases).
Then, follow the instructions for your server software or for the standalone version.

### Bukkit, BungeeCord and Velocity
Drag and drop the downloaded JAR into your `plugins/` folder. You should've downloaded the JAR that has your server software in its name.
If you've done everything right, it should work out of the box.

### Standalone
Open up the terminal, go into the directory the previously downloaded JAR is at, and then run it like this:
```shell
$ java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -jar nuvotifier-standalone.jar
```

You can also use command line arguments to configure some settings, such as the hostname:
```shell
$ java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -jar nuvotifier-standalone.jar --host 127.0.0.1 --config /etc/nuvotifier/
```

To get a full list of options, run:
```shell
$ java -jar nuvotifier-standalone.jar --help
```

### Standalone with Docker
A Docker image is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/azurejelly/standalone-nuvotifier). To pull it, run:
```shell
$ docker pull azurejelly/standalone-nuvotifier:latest
```

You can run the image using a command like:
```shell
$ docker run -p 8192:8192 \
    -v /etc/nuvotifier:/app/config \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    --name nuvotifier \
    azurejelly/standalone-nuvotifier:latest \
    --port 8192
```

This will:
- Expose port 8192 on the host machine;
- Map `/etc/nuvotifier` (host) to `/app/config` (container) using bind mounts;
- Restart the container automatically unless stopped;
- Name the container `nuvotifier`;
- Use the `azurejelly/standalone-nuvotifier:latest` image;
- And pass `--port 8192` as a command line argument to NuVotifier.
  - Not required as `8192/tcp` is already the default port, but helps to show that you can pass arguments such as `--port` or `--config`.

If you want to use Docker Compose, an example [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file is available on the repository.
